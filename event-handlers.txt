An accordion is a website widget that has a list of content sections that start collapsed. By clicking on buttons, we can open one content section at a time. When you open one content section it closes the other.

The accordion has the following requirements.

The list of accordion items (content sections) is set in the initial state. Each section is represented in state by an object with title and section keys.
The Accordion component will show a list of buttons that have their text populated by the accordion item titles.
When you click on a button, the appropriate content section should show below the button. All other open content sections should close.
Write at least one smoke test and 3 snapshot tests for this component covering the initial rendering and when 1 or 2 buttons have been clicked.
Extra: What happens if you click the same button twice in a row? You can decide what should happen here but write a test for the expected behavior.
