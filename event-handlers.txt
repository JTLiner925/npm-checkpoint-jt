An accordion is a website widget that has a list of content sections that start collapsed. By clicking on buttons, we can open one content section at a time. When you open one content section it closes the other.

The accordion has the following requirements.

The list of accordion items (content sections) is set in the initial state. Each section is represented in state by an object with title and section keys.
The Accordion component will show a list of buttons that have their text populated by the accordion item titles.
When you click on a button, the appropriate content section should show below the button. All other open content sections should close.
Write at least one smoke test and 3 snapshot tests for this component covering the initial rendering and when 1 or 2 buttons have been clicked.
Extra: What happens if you click the same button twice in a row? You can decide what should happen here but write a test for the expected behavior.

esting event listeners
To test the component more comprehensively, we should take another snapshot after clicking a button (at the very least). This would show us that the content updates when a button is clicked.

Unfortunately, we can't click on buttons in tests using react-test-renderer. The most popular library to help us click on buttons is enzyme. Enzyme is a testing library purposefully built for testing React components. It has many features such as inspecting state, debugging, traversing nodes, etc... We're going to focus on using Enzyme for testing event handlers here.

First, install Enzyme as a development dependency. There's also an enzyme-adapter-react-16 which we can use to tell Enzyme which version of React we're working with. So we'll install both.

npm install enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 --save-dev
